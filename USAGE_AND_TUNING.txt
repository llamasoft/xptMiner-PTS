Usage Overview
================
General options:
   -o, -O               The miner will connect to this url
                        You can specify a port after the url using -o url:port
   -u                   The username (workername) used for login
   -p                   The password used for login
   -t <num>             The number of threads for mining (default is 1)
   -f <num>             Donation amount for dev (default donates 3.0 to dev)

Mining options:
   -d <num>,<num>,...   List of GPU devices to use (default is 0).
   -w <num>             GPU work group size (0 = MAX, default is 0, must be power of 2)
   -v <num>             Vector size (values = 1, 2, 4; default is 1)
   -b <num>             Number of buckets to use in hashing step
                        Uses 2^N buckets (range = 12 to 99, default is 27)
   -s <num>             Size of buckets to use (0 = MAX, default is 1)
   -m <num>             Target memory usage in Megabytes, overrides "-s"
                        (Leave unset if using "-s" option)
   -n <num>             Use N bits for nonce storage (range = 10 to 26, default is 26)

Examples:
    Mining on YPool.net:
    xptminer -o ypool.net:8080 -u username.worker -p pass -b 27 -s 2

    Mining on 1GH.com:
    xptminer -o ptspool.1gh.com:18120 -u PAYOUTADDRESS -p anything -b 26 -s 4

    Mining on PTSPool.com:
    xptminer -o 112.124.13.238:28988 -u PAYOUTADDRESS -p anything -b 28 -s 1


This program uses a large amount of memory in order to mine efficiently.
The total amount of required memory in Megabytes is determined by the "-b" and "-s" options:

         |    -s 1     -s 2     -s 3     -s 4     -s 5     -s 6     -s 7
---------+--------------------------------------------------------------
   -b 22 |     528      544      560      576      592      608      624
   -b 23 |     544      576      608      640      672      704      736
   -b 24 |     576      640      704      768      832      896      960
   -b 25 |     640      768      896    1,024    1,152    1,280    1,408
   -b 26 |     768    1,024    1,280    1,536    1,792    2,048    2,304
   -b 27 |   1,024    1,536    2,048    2,560    3,072    3,584    4,096
   -b 28 |   1,536    2,560    3,584    4,608    5,632    6,656    7,680
   -b 29 |   2,560    4,608    6,656    8,704   10,752   12,800   14,848
   -b 30 |   4,608    8,704   12,800   16,896   20,992   25,088   29,184

(The exact formula is M = 512 + ((2^B * S) / 262144).)


Performance Tuning
====================
Finding the optimal configuration set for your mining setup is absolutely critical!  It means the difference
between mediocre performance and fantastic performance.  What works for one user may not well work for you,
so don't expect there to be a "magic bullet" that's always gives the best results for everybody.

Before we begin, consider installing the most recent drivers for your hardware and rebooting your system.
This will ensure that you're working from a clean state with as little performance interference as possible.
In addition, you'll need to know the amount of memory that your mining hardware has available.
To make sure that you're using all of it, I recommend setting the GPU_MAX_ALLOC_PERCENT environment variable to 100.
On Linux systems, the command will be "export GPU_MAX_ALLOC_PERCENT=100".
On Windows systems, the command will be "setx GPU_MAX_ALLOC_PERCENT 100".

Lastly, be sure to test only one device at a time and for at least 10 minutes on each setting.
Failure to do so *will* result in inaccurate performance measurements.


Automatic Approach:
---------------------
In order to use the automatic benchmark, you'll need to be on a Linux system or use Cygwin under Windows.
Simply run the "bench.sh" script and supply the base miner parameters (such as work group size and device number).

Usage: ./bench.sh [miner_opts]
Example: ./bench.sh -d 0 -w 128

The script will take a few hours to run, so it's best to let it run overnight.
The final results and parameters will be displayed and stored as bench_results.log


Manual Approcah:
------------------
1) Using the table listed above, look down the "-s 1" column to find the largest value of "-b"
   that's less than or equal to the amount of memory that your GPU has available.
   For example, if your GPU has 2048 MB of memory, "-b 28" is the highest.
   Run the miner and write down the collisions/minute value.

2) Lower the value of "-b" by one and find the largest "-s" value that's less
   than or equal to the amount of memory that your GPU has available.
   For example: if your GPU has 2048 MB of memory, "-b 27 -s 3" is the next trial.
   Run the miner and write down the results.

3) Leaving "-b" set to the value from step 2, continue trying configurations by decreasing the value of "-s" by one.
   For example: if your GPU has 2048 MB of memory, try "-b 27 -s 2" followed by "-b 27 -s 1".

4) Repeat steps 2 and 3 a few more times.  Note your best configuration for "-b" and "-s".

5) Taking the best configuration from step 4, try lowing the value of "-n" by one starting from 26.
   On the first trial that's worse than your best configuration, stop.
   For example: try adding "-n 25", if it's better then try "-n 24" instead, etc.

[optional] 6) Try also adding the "-v 2" or "-v 4" options.


Congratulations!  You've found the best configuration for your mining setup!
