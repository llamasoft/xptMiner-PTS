xptMiner is a multi-algorithm miner and reference implementation of the xpt protocol.

This is a GPU implementation of Protoshare Algorithm based on it.  
xptMiner is by jh00, GPU code by me, OpenCL libraries by Girino

This has a 3% donation which can be set using the -d option (-d 5.0 would be 5.0% donation)
